                <h2>First Article</h2>
                <p>Water is the single most important resource on the planet that we live on, and that is why
                    it is essential that we conserve it. Water is the basic necessity for all living beings, and
                    it is incredibly important to conserve it. It is not only important for living and breathing things,
                    but also
                    for many inanimate objects that humans create. For example, to build a house, we need concrete, and
                    to make concrete,
                    we need to mix cement powder with water. Water constitutes more than 70 percent of the Earthâ€™s
                    surface, and yet we do
                    not have enough water for our needs.
                    It is essential to conserve and save water for ourselves and the entire planet Earth.</p>

            <article>
                <h2>Second Article</h2>
                <p>Here, we will be providing you with two different kinds of articles on save water. The first will be
                    a 500-word article suitable for middle school, high school, and competitive exam aspirants. The
                    second article will be one of about 150-200 words, which is appropriate for younger students. These
                    articles are not only helpful for the students, but also for teachers looking for some more
                    extra-curricular material to use in their classrooms.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Third Article</h2>
                <p>There are several ways to save water, and they are very easy to inculcate in our daily lives. We must
                    not leave the tap water running when we are putting soap while washing our hands. We can use buckets
                    to take a bath rather than use the shower, no flushing of the toilet unnecessarily, always finishing
                    the water in our glasses instead of throwing it away, etc. There are many more ways to save water,
                    too, but these are just some of them for us to understand the little things that can be done.

                    It is a common saying that there is power in numbers, which means that if all of us get together and
                    do our small parts in saving water, we will surely be able to do so collectively. While individual
                    acts of saving water can do little, if all of us waste less water, or more judiciously consume
                    water, it will all add up to a greater effort.</p>
